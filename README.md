This repo contains two folders. One is for the stereo version of the piece and one is for the 8 channel version. They should be labeled in ways that make it easy enough to tell which is which. Each of those folders contains a pdf of the sheet music with setup instructions for the Max patches. The instructions were written for the stereo version.

If you have questions or need more info to get it up and running, please email jeff@jeffalbert.com or text me at 404-480-2633. Let me know if you perform the piece.
